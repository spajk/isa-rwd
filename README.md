# Responsive Web Design Course - practice resources

## Steps for pushing your solutions:
1. Clone this repository (only once :)
2. Create a new branch named `<your-git-login>/ex-XX` (e.g `desiter/ex-01`)
3. Code your solution
4. Commit your changes with a comment "ex-XX - summary" (e.g. "ex-01 - applied a flexible design approach")
5. Push your solution to `origin <branch-name>` (e.g. `origin desiter/ex-01`)
6. Create a Pull Request to `master` branch (but do NOT merge anything!)

Have fun!
